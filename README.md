sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.

**The sqlmap project is sponsored by [Netsparker Web Application Security Scanner](https://www.netsparker.com/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=sqlmap+repo&utm_campaign=generic+advert).**

There are some features that we think SQLMap should have. Like finding admin panel of the target, better hash cracking etc. If you think the same, SQLMate is for you.

## What it does?
- Feed it a SQL injection dork via <b>--dork</b> option and it will find vulnerable sites for you. After that, it will try to find their admin panels and also try to bypass them with SQL queries.

- It can do very fast hash lookups for MD5, SHA1 and SHA2. You can supply a hash with <b>--hash</b> option. Average lookup takes less than 2 seconds.

- You can also supply it a txt file containing hashes to be cracked with <b>--list <path></b> option.
  
- The first mode just checks for 13 most common admin panel locations but if you feed a website through <b>--admin</b> option, you can do a full scan using 482 paths.

- SQLMate has ability to scrap dorks as well. Specify dumping level via <b>--dump</b> option. Using <b>--dump 1</b> will dump nearly 20 dorks so set the level anywhere between 1-184 as per your needs. SQLMate automatically saves the dorks into a txt file so you can use them later.
